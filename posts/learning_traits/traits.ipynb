    "This paper, **Subliminal Learning: Language Models Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals in Data** just came out and it is really cool!\n",
    "\n",
    " - [paper blog post](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/subliminal-learning/)\n",

    "\n",
    "I thought this paper was neat, so I am going to try to reproduce a simple example quickly.\n",
    "Here is the idea for a specific use case talked about in the paper. The paper has more details\n",
    "and other use cases. But to keep things simple, I will use a specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pick a base LLM model (we will use gpt-4.1-nano)\n",
    "- take the base model and teach it a trait, such as loving owls for example\n",
    "    - this can be done through a system prompt or through fine-tuning\n",
    "    - this model with the specific trait is called the **teacher** model\n",
    "- use the teacher model to generate a dataset of random number sequences\n",
    "    - make sure these number sequences are not related to the trait in any way and nothing about the trait leaks into the generated sequences.\n",
    "        - at least in the sense that it is not obvious to a human or an LLM judge.\n",
    "- then take the original base model, without the trait, and fine-tune it on the dataset of number sequences that were generated by the teacher model\n",
    "- you should find that the fine-tuned model also has the trait! i.e. a preference for owls\n",
    "\n",
    "Fascinating!\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting the conclusion of the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A modelâ€™s outputs can contain hidden information about its traits. A student finetuned on these\n",
    "outputs can acquire these traits, if the student is similar enough to the teacher. This may present\n",
    "challenges to the alignment of models trained on model-generated outputs, an increasingly common\n",
    "practice.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code to try and run this experiment and keep things simple."
