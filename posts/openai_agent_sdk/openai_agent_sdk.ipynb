    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static_blog_imgs/agents_cogs_cartoon.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a [previous blog post](https://drchrislevy.github.io/blog), I explored various aspects of building AI agents, including coding agents, ReAct prompting, and tool-calling loops. Recently, OpenAI announced [new tools for building agents](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/), introducing the Responses API and Agents SDK. OpenAI set the standard with their Chat Completions API, which has been widely adopted and extended by developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to remain cautious. Remember what happened to the Assistants API? It never fully emerged from beta and is scheduled to be sunset in 2026. In contrast, these new APIs are not marked as beta, indicating that OpenAI feels more confident about this direction. Given their prior success with the Chat Completions API, there's reason to be optimistic that they might achieve similar success again. OpenAI has likely incorporated key learnings from their experience with the Assistants API into these latest developments, making these new tools intriguing and well worth exploring further.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Responses API\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI plans to continue supporting the [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions#the-chat-completions-api-is-not-going-away). However, for new projects, they recommend using the newly introduced [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses). \n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of the Chat Completions API I've appreciated is its wide adoption by other LLM providers, making it easy to switch between services. Because of this flexibility, it may still be practical to use Chat Completions for some new projects. It remains to be seen whether other providers will adopt the Responses API as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a screenshot from the OpenAI documentation explaining the Responses API:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static_blog_imgs/why_responses_api.png\" width=\"75%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key points to note about the Responses API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateful**: It includes a `previous_response_id` to support long-running conversations.\n",
    "- It is distinctly different from the Chat Completions API.\n",
    "- If your application doesn't require built-in tools, you can confidently continue using **Chat Completions**.\n",
    "- When ready for advanced capabilities tailored to agent workflows, the Responses API is recommended.\n",
    "- The Responses API represents OpenAI's future direction for agent-building.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not going to go over all the details of the Responses API, because that's what the docs are for.\n",
    "But I'm going to cover some things that are **new** to me.\n"

       "\"As of April 2, 2025, the next Canadian federal election is scheduled for October 20, 2025, in accordance with the fixed-date provisions of the Canada Elections Act. This date may be adjusted to October 27, 2025, to avoid conflicting with the Hindu festival of Diwali and municipal elections in Alberta. ([en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Canadian_federal_election?utm_source=openai))\\n\\nHowever, recent political developments have introduced the possibility of an earlier election. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority government has faced internal challenges, including the resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, who criticized Trudeau's leadership. Additionally, a significant number of Canadians have expressed a preference for an earlier election. A Nanos Research survey indicated that 46% of respondents would prefer the next federal election to occur before 2025.

([open-meteo-website.pages.dev](https://open-meteo-website.pages.dev/en/docs/historical-weather-api?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Step 1: Retrieve Historical Weather Data**\\n\\nWe\\'ll use the Open-Meteo Historical Weather API to fetch daily mean temperatures for Halifax from February 1, 2025, to April 2, 2025. The API requires latitude and longitude coordinates for the location. For Halifax, Nova Scotia, the approximate coordinates are:\\n\\n- Latitude: 44.6488\\n- Longitude: -63.5752\\n\\nThe API endpoint for historical weather data is:\\n\\n```\\nhttps://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive\\n```\\n\\nWe\\'ll make a GET request to this endpoint with the following parameters:\\n\\n- `latitude`: 44.6488\\n- `longitude`: -63.5752\\n- `start_date`: 2025-02-01\\n- `end_date`: 2025-04-02\\n- `daily`: temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min\\n- `timezone`: America/Halifax\\n\\n**Step 2: Fit a Statistical Model**\\n\\nAfter retrieving the historical temperature data, we\\'ll fit a time series model to predict the daily mean temperatures for the next seven days (April 3 to April 9, 2025). A common approach is to use an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is suitable for time series forecasting.\\n\\n**Step 3: Generate Predictions**\\n\\nUsing the fitted ARIMA model, we\\'ll forecast the daily mean temperatures for the specified dates.\\n\\n**Step 4: Display Predictions in a Markdown Table**\\n\\nFinally, we\\'ll present the predicted temperatures in a markdown-formatted table for clarity.\\n\\nLet\\'s proceed with the implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport requests\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n# Step 1: Retrieve Historical Weather Data\\nlatitude = 44.6488\\nlongitude = -63.5752\\nstart_date = \"2025-02-01\"\\nend_date = \"2025-04-02\"\\ntimezone = \"America/Halifax\"\\n\\nurl = f\"https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min&timezone={timezone}\"\\n\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\ndata = response.json()\\n\\n# Extract dates and temperatures\\ndates = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'time\\']\\ntemp_max = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'temperature_2m_max\\']\\ntemp_min = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'temperature_2m_min\\']\\n\\n# Calculate mean temperatures\\ntemp_mean = [(max_temp + min_temp) / 2 for max_temp, min_temp in zip(temp_max, temp_min)]\\n\\n# Create a DataFrame\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\'Date\\': pd.to_datetime(dates), \\'Mean_Temperature\\': temp_mean})\\n\\n# Step 2: Fit a Statistical Model\\n# Set the date as the index\\ndf.set_index(\\'Date\\', inplace=True)\\n\\n# Fit an ARIMA model\\nmodel = ARIMA(df[\\'Mean_Temperature\\'], order=(5, 1, 0))  # ARIMA(p, d, q)\\nmodel_fit = model.fit()\\n\\n# Step 3: Generate Predictions\\nforecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=7)\\nforecast_dates = pd.date_range(start=df.index[-1] + pd.Timedelta(days=1), periods=7)\\n\\n# Step 4: Display Predictions in a Markdown Table\\nforecast_df = pd.DataFrame({\\'Date\\': forecast_dates, \\'Predicted_Mean_Temperature\\': forecast})\\nforecast_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\\n\\n# Convert DataFrame to markdown table\\nmarkdown_table = forecast_df.to_markdown(index=False)\\n\\nprint(markdown_table)\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Ensure that the required libraries (`requests`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib`) are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip if they are not already installed:\\n\\n```\\npip install requests pandas statsmodels matplotlib\\n```\\n\\nThis script will output a markdown-formatted table with the predicted mean temperatures for Halifax, Nova Scotia, from April 3 to April 9, 2025.

([open-meteo-website.pages.dev](https://open-meteo-website.pages.dev/en/docs/historical-weather-api?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Step 1: Retrieve Historical Weather Data**\\n\\nWe\\'ll use the Open-Meteo Historical Weather API to fetch daily mean temperatures for Halifax from February 1, 2025, to April 2, 2025. The API requires latitude and longitude coordinates for the location. For Halifax, Nova Scotia, the approximate coordinates are:\\n\\n- Latitude: 44.6488\\n- Longitude: -63.5752\\n\\nThe API endpoint for historical weather data is:\\n\\n```\\nhttps://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive\\n```\\n\\nWe\\'ll make a GET request to this endpoint with the following parameters:\\n\\n- `latitude`: 44.6488\\n- `longitude`: -63.5752\\n- `start_date`: 2025-02-01\\n- `end_date`: 2025-04-02\\n- `daily`: temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min\\n- `timezone`: America/Halifax\\n\\n**Step 2: Fit a Statistical Model**\\n\\nAfter retrieving the historical temperature data, we\\'ll fit a time series model to predict the daily mean temperatures for the next seven days (April 3 to April 9, 2025). A common approach is to use an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is suitable for time series forecasting.\\n\\n**Step 3: Generate Predictions**\\n\\nUsing the fitted ARIMA model, we\\'ll forecast the daily mean temperatures for the specified dates.\\n\\n**Step 4: Display Predictions in a Markdown Table**\\n\\nFinally, we\\'ll present the predicted temperatures in a markdown-formatted table for clarity.\\n\\nLet\\'s proceed with the implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport requests\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n# Step 1: Retrieve Historical Weather Data\\nlatitude = 44.6488\\nlongitude = -63.5752\\nstart_date = \"2025-02-01\"\\nend_date = \"2025-04-02\"\\ntimezone = \"America/Halifax\"\\n\\nurl = f\"https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min&timezone={timezone}\"\\n\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\ndata = response.json()\\n\\n# Extract dates and temperatures\\ndates = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'time\\']\\ntemp_max = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'temperature_2m_max\\']\\ntemp_min = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'temperature_2m_min\\']\\n\\n# Calculate mean temperatures\\ntemp_mean = [(max_temp + min_temp) / 2 for max_temp, min_temp in zip(temp_max, temp_min)]\\n\\n# Create a DataFrame\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\'Date\\': pd.to_datetime(dates), \\'Mean_Temperature\\': temp_mean})\\n\\n# Step 2: Fit a Statistical Model\\n# Set the date as the index\\ndf.set_index(\\'Date\\', inplace=True)\\n\\n# Fit an ARIMA model\\nmodel = ARIMA(df[\\'Mean_Temperature\\'], order=(5, 1, 0))  # ARIMA(p, d, q)\\nmodel_fit = model.fit()\\n\\n# Step 3: Generate Predictions\\nforecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=7)\\nforecast_dates = pd.date_range(start=df.index[-1] + pd.Timedelta(days=1), periods=7)\\n\\n# Step 4: Display Predictions in a Markdown Table\\nforecast_df = pd.DataFrame({\\'Date\\': forecast_dates, \\'Predicted_Mean_Temperature\\': forecast})\\nforecast_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\\n\\n# Convert DataFrame to markdown table\\nmarkdown_table = forecast_df.to_markdown(index=False)\\n\\nprint(markdown_table)\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Ensure that the required libraries (`requests`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib`) are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip if they are not already installed:\\n\\n```\\npip install requests pandas statsmodels matplotlib\\n```\\n\\nThis script will output a markdown-formatted table with the predicted mean temperatures for Halifax, Nova Scotia, from April 3 to April 9, 2025.

([open-meteo-website.pages.dev](https://open-meteo-website.pages.dev/en/docs/historical-weather-api?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**Step 1: Retrieve Historical Weather Data**\\n\\nWe\\'ll use the Open-Meteo Historical Weather API to fetch daily mean temperatures for Halifax from February 1, 2025, to April 2, 2025. The API requires latitude and longitude coordinates for the location. For Halifax, Nova Scotia, the approximate coordinates are:\\n\\n- Latitude: 44.6488\\n- Longitude: -63.5752\\n\\nThe API endpoint for historical weather data is:\\n\\n```\\nhttps://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive\\n```\\n\\nWe\\'ll make a GET request to this endpoint with the following parameters:\\n\\n- `latitude`: 44.6488\\n- `longitude`: -63.5752\\n- `start_date`: 2025-02-01\\n- `end_date`: 2025-04-02\\n- `daily`: temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min\\n- `timezone`: America/Halifax\\n\\n**Step 2: Fit a Statistical Model**\\n\\nAfter retrieving the historical temperature data, we\\'ll fit a time series model to predict the daily mean temperatures for the next seven days (April 3 to April 9, 2025). A common approach is to use an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is suitable for time series forecasting.\\n\\n**Step 3: Generate Predictions**\\n\\nUsing the fitted ARIMA model, we\\'ll forecast the daily mean temperatures for the specified dates.\\n\\n**Step 4: Display Predictions in a Markdown Table**\\n\\nFinally, we\\'ll present the predicted temperatures in a markdown-formatted table for clarity.\\n\\nLet\\'s proceed with the implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport requests\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n# Step 1: Retrieve Historical Weather Data\\nlatitude = 44.6488\\nlongitude = -63.5752\\nstart_date = \"2025-02-01\"\\nend_date = \"2025-04-02\"\\ntimezone = \"America/Halifax\"\\n\\nurl = f\"https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive?latitude={latitude}&longitude={longitude}&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}&daily=temperature_2m_max,temperature_2m_min&timezone={timezone}\"\\n\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\ndata = response.json()\\n\\n# Extract dates and temperatures\\ndates = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'time\\']\\ntemp_max = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'temperature_2m_max\\']\\ntemp_min = data[\\'daily\\'][\\'temperature_2m_min\\']\\n\\n# Calculate mean temperatures\\ntemp_mean = [(max_temp + min_temp) / 2 for max_temp, min_temp in zip(temp_max, temp_min)]\\n\\n# Create a DataFrame\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\'Date\\': pd.to_datetime(dates), \\'Mean_Temperature\\': temp_mean})\\n\\n# Step 2: Fit a Statistical Model\\n# Set the date as the index\\ndf.set_index(\\'Date\\', inplace=True)\\n\\n# Fit an ARIMA model\\nmodel = ARIMA(df[\\'Mean_Temperature\\'], order=(5, 1, 0))  # ARIMA(p, d, q)\\nmodel_fit = model.fit()\\n\\n# Step 3: Generate Predictions\\nforecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=7)\\nforecast_dates = pd.date_range(start=df.index[-1] + pd.Timedelta(days=1), periods=7)\\n\\n# Step 4: Display Predictions in a Markdown Table\\nforecast_df = pd.DataFrame({\\'Date\\': forecast_dates, \\'Predicted_Mean_Temperature\\': forecast})\\nforecast_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\\n\\n# Convert DataFrame to markdown table\\nmarkdown_table = forecast_df.to_markdown(index=False)\\n\\nprint(markdown_table)\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Ensure that the required libraries (`requests`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib`) are installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip if they are not already installed:\\n\\n```\\npip install requests pandas statsmodels matplotlib\\n```\\n\\nThis script will output a markdown-formatted table with the predicted mean temperatures for Halifax, Nova Scotia, from April 3 to April 9, 2025.

If it's not already installed, you can install it using pip:\\n\\n```bash\\n!pip install yfinance\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's fetch the data:\\n\\n```python\\nimport yfinance as yf\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\\n\\n# Define the ticker symbol for DJIA\\nticker_symbol = '^DJI'\\n\\n# Calculate the start and end dates\\nend_date = datetime.today()\\nstart_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)\\n\\n# Fetch the historical data\\ndjia_data = yf.download(ticker_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)\\n\\n# Display the first few rows of the data\\nprint(djia_data.head())\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Predict the Closing Prices for the Next Week**\\n\\nFor forecasting, we'll use the `statsmodels` library, which provides tools for time series analysis. If it's not installed, install it using pip:\\n\\n```bash\\n!pip install statsmodels\\n```\\n\\nWe'll use the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA\\n\\n# Prepare the data\\nclosing_prices = djia_data['Close']\\n\\n# Fit the ARIMA model\\nmodel = ARIMA(closing_prices, order=(5, 1, 0))  # (p, d, q) order\\nmodel_fit = model.fit()\\n\\n# Forecast the next 7 days\\nforecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=7)\\n\\n# Create a date range for the forecast\\nforecast_dates = pd.date_range(start=end_date, periods=7)\\n\\n# Create a DataFrame for the forecast\\nforecast_df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': forecast_dates, 'Forecast': forecast})\\nforecast_df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)\\n\\n# Display the forecasted values\\nprint(forecast_df)\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Plot the Historical and Predicted Prices**\\n\\nFinally, we'll plot the historical closing prices along with the forecasted prices:\\n\\n```python\\n# Plot the historical and forecasted closing prices\\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\\nplt.plot(closing_prices, label='Historical Closing Prices')\\nplt.plot(forecast_df, label='Forecasted Closing Prices', linestyle='--')\\nplt.xlabel('Date')\\nplt.ylabel('DJIA Closing Price')\\nplt.title('DJIA Closing Prices: Last 30 Days and Next 7 Days Forecast')\\nplt.legend()\\nplt.grid(True)\\nplt.show()\\n```\\n\\nThis script will fetch the DJIA closing prices for the last 30 days, predict the next week's closing prices using an ARIMA model, and plot both the historical and forecasted prices in a line chart. \",\n",

    "After digging a little into OpenAI's nw suite of tools, I find myself with a balanced perspective on their offerings. The Responses API streamlines implementation, particularly for web search functionality, making it remarkably straightforward to incorporate into projects. But with it being so new, responses API format is currently limited to OpenAI's ecosystem. The practical benefits are tangible for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agents SDK demonstrates potential for prototyping agentic systems without writing repetitive code. The interface is clean and intuitive, though I'm still evaluating where multi-agent approaches provide advantages over traditional workflows in practical scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Files search, computer vision capabilities, and the new audio and text-to-speech models remain on my radar for future exploration. Their technical specifications suggest promising applications, though practical implementation will be the true test of their utility.\n",
