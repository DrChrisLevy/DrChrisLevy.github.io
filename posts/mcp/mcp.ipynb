    "- MCP servers: lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the MCP standard\n",
    "- Local Data Sources: your computers files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access\n",

    "*This configuration file tells Claude for Desktop which MCP servers to start up every time you start the application. In this case, we have added one server called “filesystem” that will use the Node npx command to install and run **@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem**. This server, described [here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem), will let you access your file system in Claude for Desktop.*\n",

There is a X post I like [here](https://x.com/akshay_pachaar/status/1929153463822569952) with some nice visuals explaining the differences between the two. I understand that MCP is much more than traditional function calling. I do like the idea of having standardized tools that I can just connect stuff to. \n",
