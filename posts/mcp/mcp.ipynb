    "\n",
    "- [MCP Specification]https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest) - requirements for servers and clients\n",

    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- each client has a dedicated 1:1 connection with a server\n",
    "- **host**: The AI application that managed and coordinates one or multiple MCP clients\n",
    "- **client**: maintains the the connection to MCP server and obtains context from the server for the MCP host to use\n",
    "- **server**: program that provides context to MCP clients\n",
    "\n",
    "When your host (claude desktop, cursor, vs-code, etc) connects to a MCP server, such as the github MCP server, \n",
    "it instantiates an MCP client object that maintains the connection to the github MCP server. If\n",
    "the host connects to another MCP server, such as the filesystem MCP server, it will instantiate an additional MCP client object.\n",
    "Therefore it ends up maintaining one to one relationships of MCP clients to MCP servers. Here is a diagram\n",
    "taken from the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture#participants):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"static_blog_imgs/mcp_one_to_one.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCP Server** refers to the program that serves the context data, regardless of where it runs\n",
    "    - MCP servers can be local or remote\n",
    "        - i.e. the filesystem MCP server is local and uses STDIO transport.\n",
    "        - a remote server such as the remote version of the github MCP server is remote and uses HTTP transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers\n",
    "MCP consists of two layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Layer**: Defines the [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC#Implementations) based protocol for client-server communication, including lifecycle management, core primitives, such as tools, resources, and prompts, and notifications. (inner layer)\n",
    "- **Transport Layer**: Defines the communication mechanisms and channels that enable data exchange between clients and servers, including transport-specific connection establishment, message framing, and authorization. (outer layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **lifecycle management**: connection initialization, capability negotiation, connection termination between client and server\n",
    "- **server features**: tools for AI actions, resources for context data, prompts for interaction templates from to the client\n",
    "- **client features**: Enables servers to ask the client to sample from the host LLM, elicit input from the user, and log messages to the client\n",
    "- **utility features**: Supports additional capabilities like notifications for real-time updates and progress tracking for long-running operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transport Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- manages communication channels and authentication between client and server\n",
    "    - Stdio transport: Uses standard input/output streams for direct process communication between local processes on the same machine, providing optimal performance with no network overhead.\n",
    "    - Streamable HTTP transport: Uses HTTP POST for client-to-server messages with optional Server-Sent Events for streaming capabilities. This transport enables remote server communication and supports standard HTTP authentication methods including bearer tokens, API keys, and custom headers. MCP recommends using OAuth to obtain authentication tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Layer Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "- [important](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture#data-layer-protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitives\n",
    "- most important concept within MCP\n",
    "#### Server Primitives\n",
    "- three core primitives that *servers* can expose \n",
    "    - Tools: Executable functions that AI applications can invoke to perform actions (e.g., file operations, API calls, database queries)\n",
    "    - Resources: Data sources that provide contextual information to AI applications (e.g., file contents, database records, API responses)\n",
    "    - Prompts: Reusable templates that help structure interactions with language models (e.g., system prompts, few-shot examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are methods for discovery (list, get, tools/call, tools/list, etc). Clients use the `*/list` methods to discover available primitives.\n",
    "- concrete example:\n",
    "    - MCP Server that provides context about a database\n",
    "    - tools for querying the DB\n",
    "    - resource that explains the schema of the DB\n",
    "    - prompt that includes few-shot examples for interacting with the tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Client Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling**: Allows servers to request language model completions from the client’s AI application. This is useful when servers authors want access to a language model, but want to stay model independent and not include a language model SDK in their MCP server. They can use the sampling/complete method to request a language model completion from the client’s AI application.\n",
    "- **Elicitation**: Allows servers to request additional information from users. This is useful when servers authors want to get more information from the user, or ask for confirmation of an action. They can use the elicitation/request method to request additional information from the user.\n",
    "- **Logging**: Enables servers to send log messages to clients for debugging and monitoring purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MCP supports real time notifications that don't have to be requested. For example the server can send a notification to the client stating that new tools are available etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "- see the detailed [example](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/architecture#example) to see a step-by-step walkthrough of an MCP client-server interaction, focusing on the data layer protocol. We’ll demonstrate the lifecycle sequence, tool operations, and notifications using JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.\n"

    "- Sampling allows servers to request language model completions through the client, enabling agentic behaviors while maintaining security and user control.\n",
    "- Sampling enables servers to perform AI-dependent tasks without directly integrating with or paying for AI models. Instead, servers can request that the client—which already has AI model access—handle these tasks on their behalf. This approach puts the client in complete control of user permissions and security measures. Because sampling requests occur within the context of other operations—like a tool analyzing data—and are processed as separate model calls, they maintain clear boundaries between different contexts, allowing for more efficient use of the context window.\n",
    "- consider air line booking example - user asks find best flight and tools are used to fetch 47 flight options - then the server can request AI assistance (via sampling) to analyze the flight data to pick best option. The client asks the user \"allow sampling request?\"\n",

    "- Elicitation enables servers to request specific information from users during interactions, creating more dynamic and responsive workflows.\n",
    "- Elicitation provides a structured way for servers to gather necessary information on demand. Instead of requiring all information up front or failing when data is missing, servers can pause their operations to request specific inputs from users. This creates more flexible interactions where servers adapt to user needs rather than following rigid patterns.\n",
