    "# OpenAI and Anthropic APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's spend a bit of time going through\n",
    "some similarities and differences between the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs when using their LLMs for\n",
    "inference and function calling. I am quite familiar with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) because I have been using it for more than a year. However, Anthropic's API is quite new to me. I think this is likely true for many people building with LLMs, simply because OpenAI was there to build upon first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently I have started using Anthropic's latest model, claude-3-5-sonnet, through the browser interface.\n",
    "I really like it so I wanted to also learn to use it through the Python SDK. Anthropic's API [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started) is great. Another great way to learn \n",
    "about the Anthropic python API is to read the source code for [answer.ai](https://www.answer.ai/)'s wrapper [Claudette](https://x.com/jeremyphoward/status/1805062541158343018). Usually I would not point people to a wrapper to learn the underlying API but in this case the [source code for Claudette](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html) is a readable notebook that walks you through all the code. I found this to be an amazing resource for learning the Anthropic python SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Own Wrapper with an Emphasis on the \"Tool Calling Loop\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written my own wrapper classes around some functionality of OpenAI and Anthropic.\n",
    "Here are some reasons why I did this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best way to learn is to write it yourself. The best wrapper is the one you write and test yourself, and fully understand. \n",
    "- I wanted to write a wrapper that was focused on tool/function calling and provide a similar interface between OpenAI and Anthropic.\n",
    "- I wanted to add in some features specific to tool calling such as parallel execution, and followup calls (tool calling loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to understand my wrapper to understand this blog post. I'm not going to show any of the code for it. \n",
    "At the end of the day it's just using OpenAI and Anthropic python libraries for interacting with their models. The wrapper is not really what's important here. The focus will be on the tool calling loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Tool Calling Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "![](imgs/llm_tool_call_loop.png){width=\"45%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "I want the tool calling loop in my wrapper to be able to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call functions in parallel when possible. For example, if the LLM says to call several tools which are independent of each other, then these functions should be executed in parallel (not sequentially).\n",
    "- Handle followup tool calls if necessary. For example, if the output of one tool is required as the input to another tool, allow the LLM to decide if more followup tool calls are required.\n",
    "- Work with both Anthropic and OpenAI tool calling, using a similar interface.\n",
    "- Keep record of all the tool calls, the inputs, the outputs, etc. This is useful for debugging and for the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is essentially the \"tool calling loop\" with some custom logic for my own use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**USER:** I want to book a flight for Boston or New York. Pick the location that has the better weather. Thanks!\n",
    "\n",
    "**ASSISTANT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- calls `get_weather(Boston)` and `get_weather(New York)` independently and in parallel.\n",
    "- Picks the location with the best weather (Boston).\n",
    "- calls `book_flight(Boston)`\n",
    "- Provides final assistant message to user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool calling loop bundles up this logic into a single python function.\n"

    "## API Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with comparing OpenAI chat completions and Anthropic message creations.\n",
    "I'm using my wrapper class here but all the basics/foundations are the same. The returned objects\n",
    "are just dictionaries and not the usual Pydantic objects. But it does not matter. If you have used either API before then\n",
    "all this will be pretty familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major difference is that the `system` prompt has its own [field argument for Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts#how-to-give-claude-a-role). Whereas with the OpenAI messages format\n",
    "you provide the system role as the first message. It's just personal preference but since I started with OpenAI, I like that way\n",
    "of working with the system prompt. So the first thing I did with my Anthropic wrapper is implement the system prompt similar to how OpenAI does it.\n",
    "This way I can pass similar `messages` objects to either wrapper as input. Let's make this clear through a demonstration."
