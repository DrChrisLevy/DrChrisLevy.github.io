    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "I have experience fine-tuning smaller encoder style LLMs such as [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) for classification style tasks. \n",
    "I have deployed such models in a production environment and have had great success with them. The [Hugging Face trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tasks/sequence_classification) class makes it relatively easy and the models are easy to deploy, even on CPU based infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when it comes to training decoder style LLMs for text generation (GPT, [llama](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/llama2), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [Qwen](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen?tab=readme-ov-file), [Gemma](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma), etc.), I will be the first to admit that I am a complete noob. It's something I have followed from a distance, trying to keep up with the recent methods/libraries, but I have not had any experience with it in terms of actual hands on practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't want to get into the debate on whether [Fine-Tuning LLMs is valuable](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/fine_tuning_valuable.html). The answer is probably most likely, \"it depends\". It's something I want to learn more about, and just want to get started. There are so many new terms/ideas to learn (PEFT, LORA, QLORA, TRL, RHLF, DPO, etc.). My academic mathematical background says to start from the bottom and learn everything along the way. I know that is horrible advice in practice though because I will just get stuck. Instead, I will take advice from [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward) which is to begin at the top and just get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in this post I will fine-tune my first model with the [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) library. The model will probably suck, but that's not the point. Whenever I learn a new tool/library the first thing is to set things up and run a \"hello world\" type example. Even if it's just copy/paste. That's what I will do here. Don't come here for advanced advice. Follow along if you are in a similar situation as me and just want to get started."

    "Output: *My name is Cal  And this is the Deep Questions podcast, episode 238. I'm here in my Deep Work HQ joined by my producer, Jesse. Jesse, how are you doing? Good, good. Glad to be here, glad to be here. Before we jump into today's questions, there was a couple of announcements I wanted to make. The Deep Questions podcast is proud to be a sponsor of the 2023 Tropical Health and Wellness Summit, the THW summit that I have been talking about on the show. The summit brings together experts on health and wellness from a wide variety of fields, nutrition, fitness and so on. It allows you to enjoy a full-day virtual conference with the top experts to help you cultivate a healthier and deeper life. You can join from wherever you are and whenever you want, because the talks are available 24 hours a day on demand. If you're watching this at youtube.com slash Cal Newport media, this will be the THW summit. A lot of good talks I thought, like the one I talked about last week with Mark Sisson and the whole day of these type of speakers talking, so you should definitely check it out. So go to T-H-E-W-S-U-M-M-I-T dot com slash Cal, T-H-E-W-S-U-M-M-I-T dot com slash Cal, that's all lowercase and all one word, dot com slash Cal to register for free. And if you happen to mention in the registration that you came from deep questions, they will give you a free book to Mark Sisson's last book, a new definition of fitness. All right, so that's thws.com slash Cal. I also wanna briefly mention one of the sponsors that makes this podcast possible, which is ExpressVPN. See, if you're like me, you are worried when you use the internet that people have access to what are you talking about and who are you talking to? The way that you can prevent this from being an issue is by using a VPN. Instead of directly connecting to whatever website or service you wanna use, you instead connect to a VPN server. You explain that server who you wanna talk to. And then that server talks to that website or service on your behalf, encrypts the response and sends it back. Now the people you're connected to access point, the people who are watching the packets you're sending, they don't have a way of knowing for sure who you're talking to, what you're saying. Here's the thing, a VPN really is needed in a world of widespread surveillance. So we're talking about the people who are at the internet service provider level like your internet service provider, who can see all this stuff. They can see who you're connecting to, but just the fact that you're using a VPN blocks them from collecting all of that data.*\n",

    "Output: *Social media is bad. Dont use it. Here is why.  And that was the end of the conversation. And I think that approach, which is the approach that's common today to talking about digital tech and kids, does more harm than good. So I wanna give two examples to illustrate the potential harms of this simplified response. The first comes from my own experience when I was a teen. I was a tech writer for a while when I was in high school, published my second book, How to Win at College when I was 19. In an interview, I talked about digital distractions and teenage life. And the reaction from readers was pretty severe. I received a lot of angry emails about this. There's been a lot of yelling at me on social media for things that I was suggesting. And I did some public appearances and, you know, got grilled pretty hard on these topics. I actually have this one example I remember. So I didn't give this talk on the radio, the local NPR in D.C. And so the whole interview was, I was being grilled about kids and tech. And here's the key question that was asked. So the host said, okay, this question comes from Sam. He's a 49-year-old teacher and he doesn't have kids, which was a nice turn of phrases, right? So 49-year-old teacher, does not have kids. He says, can kids really do math or write these days? Like, do you think that all the screen time has gotten them so lost that they've forgotten how to actually write or hold a pencil or solve even a simple addition problem? And then he goes on about like, okay, the way these kids walk or whatever. And then he says, he's a teacher, I don't want to get fired, right? I mean a lot of teachers have sent this stuff to me, but this was a good version of it. I do a fair number of, he's like, I don't want to get fired. All right, so I think he was worried about his job safety. I'm gonna get thrown out of his job for asking this question. All right, so then the host said, okay, well, Cal, you're on the spot. What do you say? So I had to give an answer and my answer was, let me start by dismissing this particular point as being, and I wasn't mean, I tried to be gentle, but I was dismissing this particular point as being somewhat silly. Right, because if we're talking about the impact of social media on math and science achievements, there is not a huge body of scholastic literature on this. So this is a little bit of anecdote. If we're talking about impact of social media and video games on attention, let's start with attention span.*\n",
