    "Server-Sent Events (SSE) are a web technology that allow servers to push real-time updates to web clients over a single HTTP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests where the client must repeatedly ask for new data, SSE creates a one-way channel from the server to the client that stays open, allowing the server to send updates whenever they're available.\n",

    "In this blog post, I will go through some examples of how to use SSE in [FastHTML](https://docs.fastht.ml/). FastHTML is a new web framework for building web applications with minimal compact code, and completely in Python! It would certainly help to have run some examples of FastHTML before reading this post. Some familiarity with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) is also useful. The [htmx.org website](https://htmx.org/extensions/sse/) has a great explanation of how to use the htmx Server Sent Event (SSE) extension.  [MonsterUI](https://monsterui.answer.ai/) is a library of components built on top of FastHTML. It will also be used in the examples below. Both FastHTML and MonsterUI are developed by [Answer AI](https://answer.ai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this post to help myself understand SSE in FastHTML and to share what I learned. It's not meant to be a comprehensive guide. Rather, it's a collection of examples that I hope will be helpful for myself to refer back to as I continue to learn more about FastHTML and SSE and work on personal projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want to try some of the examples yourself, you can copy any of the examples into a file called `main.py` and run it with `python main.py`. You will need to have FastHTML and MonsterUI installed. You can install them with \n",

    "pip install python-fasthtml monsterui\n",

    "## Breaking Down The Example in Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Page Load\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user navigates to the root URL, the browser sends a `GET` request to the server.\n",
    "The server responds with the HTML generated by the `index()` function, which creates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A container with a heading \"Intro SSE Example\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- A div with ID \"sse-content\" containing an introductory paragraph. This div has several HTMX attributes that configure SSE behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The browser renders this initial HTML, showing the heading and the introductory paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSE Connection Establishment\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser sees the `hx_ext=\"sse\"` and `sse_connect=\"/sse-stream\"` attributes on the div and recognizes that it needs to establish a Server-Sent Events connection.\n",
    "The browser automatically opens an `EventSource` connection to the `/sse-stream` endpoint.\n",
    "On the server, when this connection request arrives, it triggers the `sse_stream()` function, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a new instance of the `message_generator()` coroutine\n",
    "- Wraps it in an `EventStream` response object\n",
    "- Sends the appropriate HTTP headers to establish an SSE connection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Streaming Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established, the `message_generator()` coroutine begins execution:\n",
    "For each iteration (0-9):\n",
    "\n",
    "- It creates an HTML message containing \"message number {i}\"\n",
    "- Converts this to SSE format with the event name \"EventName\"\n",
    "- Yields this message, which is immediately sent to the browser\n",
    "- Pauses for 0.5 seconds using `await sleep(0.5)`\n",
    "- During this pause, the server can handle other requests because of the use of `async`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the 10 numbered messages, it sends a final message containing \"DONE\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-Side Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "As each SSE message arrives at the browser, HTMX intercepts it because of the `hx_ext=\"sse\"` attribute.\n",
    "It checks the event name in the message (\"EventName\") and matches it against the `sse_swap=\"EventName\"` attribute.\n",
    "Since they match, HTMX processes this message\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of each message is inserted into the div according to the `hx_swap=\"beforeend show:bottom\"` attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `beforeend`: Each new message is added at the end of the existing content\n",
    "- `show:bottom`: The page automatically scrolls to show the new content\n",
    "\n",
    "The user sees each message appear approximately every half second, with the page scrolling to keep the latest message visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection Behavior After Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "After the final \"DONE\" message, the generator is exhausted, but the SSE connection doesn't automatically close.\n",
    "The browser's `EventSource` implementation will detect the end of the stream and automatically attempt to reconnect after a brief delay.\n",
    "This reconnection will trigger another call to `sse_stream()`, creating a new instance of `message_generator()`, and the sequence will start over.\n",
    "This cycle will continue indefinitely, with the div accumulating more and more messages, unless the page is navigated away from or the connection is explicitly closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a surprise to me when first learning about SSE. I expected the connection to close after the initial `for` loop completed.\n",

    "I would like to spend more time to figure out a more efficient solution. You can see there is also a bit of \"jankiness\" each time formulas and code blocks are rerendered. My goal would be to mimick what OpenAI and Anthropic do with streaming, and only have small chunks of text in the message come through the SSE connection. All while rendering the markdown correctly in real time and having everything look nice. Maybe I will put some more thought into this and update the blog post with a more efficient solution in the near future. "

    "# Conclusion and Recap of Main Attributes for Server Sent Events in FastHTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick summary of what we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hx_ext=\"sse\"` - This is required to use the SSE extension.\n",
    "- `sse_connect=\"<url>\"` - The URL of the SSE endpoint\n",
    "- `sse_swap=\"<message-name>\"` - The name of the message to swap into the DOM.\n",
    "- `sse_swap=\"event_name1,event_name2\"` - To listen for multiple message types on a single element.\n",
    "- `hx_trigger=\"sse:<message-name>\"` - SSE messages can also trigger HTTP callbacks using the `hx_trigger` attribute.\n",
    "- `sse_close=<message-name>` - To close the `EventStream` gracefully when that message is received. This might be helpful if you want to send information to a client that will eventually stop.\n",
    "- `hx_swap=\"beforeend show:bottom\"` - While not specific to SSE, this is commonly used with SSE to control how content is inserted (append at the end) and handled (scroll to show the new content).\n",
    "- `hx_target=\"#element-id\"` - Specifies where the SSE message content should be inserted (if not the element itself).\n",
    "- On the server side, remember the key function: `sse_message(element, event=\"message\")` - Converts an FT component into the format required for SSE, with an optional event name (defaults to \"message\"). \n",
