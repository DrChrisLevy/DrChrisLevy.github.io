    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Server-Sent Events (SSE) are a web technology that allow servers to push real-time updates to web clients over a single HTTP connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests where the client must repeatedly ask for new data, SSE creates a one-way channel from the server to the client that stays open, allowing the server to send updates whenever they're available.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SSE Diagram](static_blog_imgs/sse_diag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key characteristics of SSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-directional: Data flows only from server to client\n",
    "- Uses standard HTTP (unlike WebSockets which use a different protocol)\n",
    "    - WebSockets are bidirectional, meaning data can flow both ways - from server to client and from client to server over the same connection. This makes WebSockets suitable for applications requiring real-time communication in both directions, like chat applications or multiplayer games.\n",
    "    - In contrast, SSE are strictly one-directional (server to client only).\n",
    "    - This fundamental difference in communication flow is one of the key factors to consider when choosing between these technologies for your application.\n",
    "- Automatically reconnects if the connection is lost\n",
    "- Lightweight compared to alternatives like WebSockets\n",
    "- Built into browsers with the EventSource API"

    "** TODO: Run The Example as A Video Or Embedded App In the BLOG!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breaking Down The Example in Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Page Load\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user navigates to the root URL, the browser sends a `GET` request to the server.\n",
    "The server responds with the HTML generated by the `index()` function, which creates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A container with a heading \"Intro SSE Example\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- A div with ID \"sse-content\" containing an introductory paragraph. This div has several HTMX attributes that configure SSE behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The browser renders this initial HTML, showing the heading and the introductory paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSE Connection Establishment\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser sees the `hx_ext=\"sse\"` and `sse_connect=\"/sse-stream\"` attributes on the div and recognizes that it needs to establish a Server-Sent Events connection.\n",
    "The browser automatically opens an `EventSource` connection to the `/sse-stream` endpoint.\n",
    "On the server, when this connection request arrives, it triggers the `sse_stream()` function, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a new instance of the `message_generator()` coroutine\n",
    "- Wraps it in an `EventStream` response object\n",
    "- Sends the appropriate HTTP headers to establish an SSE connection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message Streaming Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established, the `message_generator()` coroutine begins execution:\n",
    "For each iteration (0-9):\n",
    "\n",
    "- It creates an HTML message containing \"message number {i}\"\n",
    "- Converts this to SSE format with the event name \"EventName\"\n",
    "- Yields this message, which is immediately sent to the browser\n",
    "- Pauses for 0.5 seconds using `await sleep(0.5)`\n",
    "- During this pause, the server can handle other requests because of the use of `async`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the 10 numbered messages, it sends a final message containing \"DONE\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-Side Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "As each SSE message arrives at the browser, HTMX intercepts it because of the `hx_ext=\"sse\"` attribute.\n",
    "It checks the event name in the message (\"EventName\") and matches it against the `sse_swap=\"EventName\"` attribute.\n",
    "Since they match, HTMX processes this message\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of each message is inserted into the div according to the `hx_swap=\"beforeend show:bottom\"` attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `beforeend`: Each new message is added at the end of the existing content\n",
    "- `show:bottom`: The page automatically scrolls to show the new content\n",
    "\n",
    "The user sees each message appear approximately every half second, with the page scrolling to keep the latest message visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection Behavior After Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "After the final \"DONE\" message, the generator is exhausted, but the SSE connection doesn't automatically close.\n",
    "The browser's `EventSource` implementation will detect the end of the stream and automatically attempt to reconnect after a brief delay.\n",
    "This reconnection will trigger another call to `sse_stream()`, creating a new instance of `message_generator()`, and the sequence will start over.\n",
    "This cycle will continue indefinitely, with the div accumulating more and more messages, unless the page is navigated away from or the connection is explicitly closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a surprise to me when first learning about SSE. I expected the connection to close after the initial `for` loop completed.\n",
    "\n",
