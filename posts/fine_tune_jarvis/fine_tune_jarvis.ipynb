It started off as a fine-tuning course and then kind of exploded into a mini conference with numerous speakers and talks on LLMs. Many of the organizations involved gave out free credits to try out their platform.

    "The idea of this dataset and fine-tuning a model from it is simple. You provide a list of social media posts from a user. Then you can ask the model to either generate a list of interests/keywords or write a summary based on the input posts. Note that this is a very simple task\n",
    "which can be achieved with existing closed or open source instruction models. So technically fine-tuning is not required for this task in most scenarios. But this exercise is for educational purposes so let's continue.\n",

    "I am an avid surfer and ocean enthusiast, finding solace and joy in the waves. Surfing is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life that brings me clarity, purpose, and a deep connection to the sea. I often share my surfing adventures and experiences, capturing the beauty of the ocean through social media posts. Beyond surfing, I enjoy spending time with family, embracing moments of humor, and celebrating love and diversity. Adventure, joy, and a deep appreciation for the natural world define my lifestyle, and I find happiness in sharing these passions with others.<|end_of_text|>\n",
