    "**\"Agent\"** can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic** systems, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\n",

    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "## Agent Definition from Hugging Face Blog Post on `smolagents` - [source](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any efficient system using AI will need to provide LLMs some kind of access to the real world: for instance the possibility to call a search tool to get external information, or to act on certain programs in order to solve a task. In other words, LLMs should have agency. Agentic programs are the gateway to the outside world for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** are programs where LLM outputs control the workflow. Note that with this definition, **\"agent\"** is not a discrete, 0 or 1 definition: instead, \"agency\" evolves on a continuous spectrum, as you give more or less power to the LLM on your workflow.\n",
    ":::\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a lot of debate and discussion on what exactly is an agent and what is not an agent. I think there is a lot of gray area here and something we \n",
    "have to just accept, at least for now. I think Andrew Ng makes some really good points in this [tweet](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1801295202788983136). As Andrew points out, rather than engaging in binary debates about whether something qualifies as a \"true agent,\" we should think about systems as existing on a spectrum of agent-like qualities.  The adjective \"agentic\" itself becomes particularly useful here, allowing us to describe systems that incorporate agent-like patterns to different degrees without getting caught in restrictive definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This spectrum-based view is reinforced by Anthropic's recent [blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) on agents. They acknowledge that while they draw an architectural distinction between workflows (systems with predefined code paths) and agents (systems with dynamic control), they categorize both under the broader umbrella of \"agentic systems.\" Similarly, we saw from one of our definitions above that \"agent\" isn't a discrete, 0 or 1 definition, but rather evolves on a continuous spectrum as you give more or less power to the LLM in your system. This aligns with Andrew Ng's observation that there's a gray zone between what clearly is not an agent (prompting a model once) and what clearly is (an autonomous system that plans, uses tools, and executes multiple steps independently).\n",

    "![[image source: Blog post from Nathan Lambert on the AI Agent Spectrum](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-ai-agent-spectrum)](imgs/llm_loop_is_agent.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nathan Lambert also writes about the AI agent spectrum in this [blog post](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-ai-agent-spectrum). Nathan discusses that the simplest system on this spectrum would be any tool-use language model and that the spectrum of agents increases in complexity from there. I like how Nathan makes the point that the spectrum will continue to evolve and that the definition of an agent will continue to change as the field evolves. Over time, certain technologies will reach milestones where they become definitive examples of AI agents. Therefore at some point, basic tool use with an LLM may not be considered an agent, even though it's the basic starting point on the agentic spectrum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Personally, agents and agentic workflows are still so new to me and I have a lot to learn on this topic. I have deployed LLMs in production as well as built some applications where LLMs use function calling (tools) within a conversational chat interface. So I think some of my previous work has fallen somewhere within this AI agentic spectrum, even if it's at one end of the spectrum. I'm going to  keep an open mind and avoid getting caught up in debates about categorical definitions. I'll try to avoid the hype and marketing fluff but be on the lookout for innovation and practical applications. \n",

    "So where do we even start on this spectrum of AI agents? Practically, I think the first step is to start with an LLM equipped with tools.\n",

    "This is the building block, an LLM equipped with tools. I think we need to take it slightly further and make it clear we need a tool calling loop. There are two distinct loops here\n",
    "I want to discuss. The entire process is kicked off by sending the user request to the LLM. The LLM then decides on the initial tool calls. These tool calls can be executed in parallel since the results of each tool call are independent of one another. The second loop is to handle follow up tool calls. These are tool calls that are dependent on the results of previous tool calls. Implementing this logic together is what I refer to as the \"tool calling loop\". \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote about this tool calling loop in a previous [blog_post](https://drchrislevy.github.io/posts/anthropic/anthropic.html#my-own-wrapper-with-an-emphasis-on-the-tool-calling-loop). Here is an image I created during the writing of that post to illustrate the concept. \n",

    "and still use the same OpenAI API format. If you have never used `litellm` before that is fine! This is my first time using it.\n",
    "All you need to know is that `from litellm import completion` is the same as calling `chat.completions.create(...)` from the `openai` library.\n"

    "    - maybe some interesting ideas here for agents?\n",
    "- a single LLM call is not agentic!\n",
    "- an augmented LLM with tools may not be an agent but rather on the agentic spectrum, according to anthropic blog post.\n",
    "- one cool thing about multi agents is that each agent is modular and can be good at one thing. Also these agents can be different models/prompts/providers etc.\n",
    "- from CrewAI - role playing, focus, tools, cooperation, guardrails, memory\n",
    "    - role playing - give the agent a role/persona with system prompt, careful consideration of role and backstory for the agent\n",
    "    - focus - Too much tools, too much context, etc. Make agent focus on one thing. Don't let agent do too much. \n",
    "    - tools - too many tools or overload of tools can lead to issues. Choose the tools carefully for each agent and not too many.\n",
    "    - cooperation - multi agent cooperation. Just like human can intteract with ChatGPT in iterative manner to get better results/outputs, the LLM agents can interact with each other anc accept feedback, delegate tasks.\n",
    "    - guardrails - agents getting stuck doing loops, derailing, etc. Many frameworks have guardrails built in.\n",
    "    - memory - ability for the agent to remember what it has done, what it has learned, etc. Short term memory is mmemory during execution of a task. share knowledge, activities. and learnings with agents. sharing intermedia information even before task completion. Long term memory - after the crew is finished. Stored in DB. LOng term memory can be used in future tasks. Leads to self improving agents.\n",
    "    - process i.e. process.hierarchical\n",
    "- CrewAI advice:\n",
    "    - think like a manager \n",
    "    - Cache tool responses across all agents \n",
