    "An artificial intelligence (AI) agent is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals.\n",

    "\n",
    "**\"Agent\"** can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic** systems, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\n",

    "## Agent Definition from Hugging Face Blog Post on `smolagents` - [source](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any efficient system using AI will need to provide LLMs some kind of access to the real world: for instance the possibility to call a search tool to get external information, or to act on certain programs in order to solve a task. In other words, LLMs should have agency. Agentic programs are the gateway to the outside world for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** are programs where LLM outputs control the workflow. Note that with this definition, **\"agent\"** is not a discrete, 0 or 1 definition: instead, \"agency\" evolves on a continuous spectrum, as you give more or less power to the LLM on your workflow\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a lot of debate and discussion on what exactly is an agent and what is not an agent. I think there is a lot of gray area here and something we \n",
    "have to just accept, at least for now. I think Andrew Ng makes some really good points in this [tweet](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1801295202788983136). As Andrew points out, rather than engaging in binary debates about whether something qualifies as a \"true agent,\" we should think about systems as existing on a spectrum of agent-like qualities.  The adjective \"agentic\" itself becomes particularly useful here, allowing us to describe systems that incorporate agent-like patterns to different degrees without getting caught in restrictive definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This spectrum-based view is reinforced by Anthropic's recent [blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) on agents. They acknowledge that while they draw an architectural distinction between workflows (systems with predefined code paths) and agents (systems with dynamic control), they categorize both under the broader umbrella of \"agentic systems.\" Similarly, we saw from one of our definitions above that \"agent\" isn't a discrete, 0 or 1 definition, but rather evolves on a continuous spectrum as you give more or less power to the LLM in your system. This aligns with Andrew Ng's observation that there's a gray zone between what clearly is not an agent (prompting a model once) and what clearly is (an autonomous system that plans, uses tools, and executes multiple steps independently).\n",

    "![[Nathan Lambert Blog Post on the AI Agent Spectrum](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-ai-agent-spectrum)](imgs/llm_loop_is_agent.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nathan Lambert also writes about the AI agent spectrum in this [blog post](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/the-ai-agent-spectrum). Nathan discusses that the simplest system on this spectrum would be any tool-use language model and that the spectrum of agents increases in complexity from there. I like how Nathan makes the point that the spectrum will continue to evolve and that the definition of an agent will continue to change as the field evolves. Over time, certain technologies will reach milestones where they become definitive examples of AI agents. Therefore at some point, basic tool use with an LLM may not be considered an agent, even though it's the basic starting point on the agentic spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, agents and agentic workflows are still so new to me and I have a lot to learn on this topic. I have deployed LLMs in production as well as built some applications where LLMs use function calling (tools) within a conversational chat interface. So I think some of my previous work has fallen somewhere within this agentic spectrum, even if it's at one end of the spectrum. I'm going to try and keep an open mind and avoid getting caught up in debates about categorical definitions. I'll try to avoid the hype and marketing fluff but be on the lookout for innovation and practical applications. \n",

    "- from CrewAI - role playing, focus, tools, cooperation, guardrails, memory\n",
    "    - role playing - give the agent a role/persona with system prompt, careful consideration of role and backstory for the agent\n",
    "    - focus - Too much tools, too much context, etc. Make agent focus on one thing. Don't let agent do too much. \n",
    "    - tools - too many tools or overload of tools can lead to issues. Choose the tools carefully for each agent and not too many.\n",
    "    - cooperation - multi agent cooperation. Just like human can intteract with ChatGPT in iterative manner to get better results/outputs, the LLM agents can interact with each other anc accept feedback, delegate tasks.\n",
    "    - guardrails - agents getting stuck doing loops, derailing, etc. Many frameworks have guardrails built in.\n",
    "    - memory - ability for the agent to remember what it has done, what it has learned, etc. Short term memory is mmemory during execution of a task. share knowledge, activities. and learnings with agents. sharing intermedia information even before task completion. Long term memory - after the crew is finished. Stored in DB. LOng term memory can be used in future tasks. Leads to self improving agents.\n",
