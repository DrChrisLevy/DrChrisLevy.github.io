    "Lately, I've been following [FastHTML](https://about.fastht.ml/) from a distance. As someone who sticks to backend Python development, frontend development has always been a bit foreign to me, but I'm interested in giving it a shot. FastHTML feels like a good way to get started with some basics by building small apps.\n",

    "I've also noticed a lot of chatter on X about [Colpali](https://github.com/illuin-tech/colpali) and document retrieval with vision language models, which caught my attention. I like exploring new stuff so I want to see what that is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, I'm still enjoying [Modal](https://modal.com/), which I’ve written about before [here](https://drchrislevy.github.io/posts/modal_fun/modal_blog.html) and [here](https://drchrislevy.github.io/posts/intro_modal/intro_modal.html). I figured why not combine all these tools into a simple app and see what I can learn from it.\n",
