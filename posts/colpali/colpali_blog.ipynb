As someone who sticks to backend Python development, frontend development has always been a bit foreign to me, but I'm interested in giving it a shot. FastHTML feels like a good way to get started with some basics by building small apps.\n",

    "I've also noticed a lot of chatter on X about [Colpali](https://github.com/illuin-tech/colpali) and document retrieval with vision language models, which caught my attention. I like exploring new stuff so I want to see what that is all about.\n",
