**Hello!** I'm Chris Levy, an AI Engineer. I build practical AI systems using Python and modern ML technologies, and I'm always excited to learn new approaches.

I focus on building AI applications, with my main skill being backend development and Python. With a PhD in applied mathematics (2015) and years of industry experience across the ML stack, I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning them into practical solutions.

Outside of day to day work, I enjoy spending time with my family and three kids, working out, swimming, cycling, playing guitar, and coding and writing.
