**Hello!** I'm Chris Levy. I work in ML/AI and backend Python development.

## About Me

I spent a good amount of time in school where I completed a PhD in applied math back in 2015. After graduating
I shifted away from academia and started working in industry. I mostly do backend python development these days,
and build ML/AI applications/services. I work across the entire stack from research, to training and evaluating models,
to deploying models, and getting in the weeds of the infrastructure and devops pipelines.

Outside of AI/ML stuff, I enjoy spending time with my family and three kids, working out, swimming, cycling, and playing guitar.
